here is a fix for a problem i faced recently 
i use programs to download complete playlist from youtube but those programs download videos without any order 
also ,,  who made the videos did not put any number for each video ,, so when i finish downloading them i get aa heart attack as they are not sorted 
what this program do ?
this is a simple program using python to scaper the playlist of the videos and put thier names in a file
 and it also need the direction where your downloaded playlist is  
and python would compare between each of them to put the right number before each video
